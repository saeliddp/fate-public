<p class="description">For this game, you will be shown a search query and two sets of top-10 results. You will have 30 seconds to pick the set which you think comes directly from Google. If you get it right, you earn 10 points. For being wrong, you lose 5 points. There will be 20 such questions. At the end of it, you can see your total score and where you stand in the leaderboard. Please read the consent form below and if you agree, click 'I agree' to start the game!
